Research Sidebar Addon
=================

This is a project written for Google Docs as a web add on. Important aspects of the project include:

1. Opening a sidebar from a custom menu in Google Docs
2. Being able to refence static objects and loop through their inner objects and arrays to display content.
3. Using bootstrap as a externally hosted stylesheet.
4. Inserting text at the cursor.
5. Asking the user to view text and then insert by hitting Yes (not currently used, but function is built.
6. Performing a simple calculation via a menu prompt and then inserting the result at the cursor.

Future iterations of this project will include text styling, potentially some other calculations, and pulling hosted data from either Google Cloud MySQL or a Google Sheet.
